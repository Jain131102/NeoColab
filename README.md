# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab

Welcome to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab-NeoColab** repository! This collection contains structured lab work for learning and implementing core algorithmic concepts using Java.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

Each lab focuses on a different topic related to algorithms and data structures:

| Sr. No. | Title                                | Description                                               |
|--------:|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lab 1   | Prim's and Kruskal's                 | Implementation of Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms.       |
| Lab 2   | Strongly Connected Graph             | Algorithms like Kosaraju's or Tarjan's for SCC detection. |
| Lab 3   | Greedy & Dynamic Programming         | Greedy and DP-based problem solving techniques.           |
| Lab 4   | Optimal Ordering                     | Solutions to sequencing and scheduling problems.          |
| Lab 5   | Shortest Path Algorithm              | Dijkstra's and/or Bellman-Ford implementations.           |
| Lab 6   | Binary Search Tree                   | Implementation and traversal of BSTs.                     |
| Lab 7   | 0/1 Knapsack                         | Solving the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem using backtracking.|
| PDF        | Concept Builder 1-7                  | A compiled reference document with multiple-choice question (MCQ) to build conceptual understanding for Labs 1 to 7.|
